        <h1>King Talal Dam</h1>
        <p>King Talal Dam is considered one of the largest dams in Jordan, with a storage capacity of 75 million cubic metres. The
        dam was constructed in 1977. The dam is located in Jerash Governorate, specifically in the Tal Rumman Heights area. It
        is a type of rockfill dam and has a length of 109 meters. It forms a large reservoir of water in Zarqa Valley, where the
        Zarqa River is considered the main source of inflow to the dam. The river has two main sources that make it flow
        greatly. The first source is rainwater and surface runoff, and the second source is groundwater, which flows from the
        far east.</p>
