            <h1>JORDAN</h1>
            <p>Jordan’s terrain is incredibly diverse and stunningly beautiful. From the red-orange deserts of Wadi Rum with towering
            sandstone cliffs and sweeping sand dunes, to the ancient rock-carved city of Petra, and the fertile green hills and
            valleys in the north, the landscapes are breathtaking. The shimmering Dead Sea adds a unique touch to its scenery.
            Alongside its natural beauty, Jordan is famous for its delicious traditional cuisine, including falafel, hummus, mansaf,
            and fresh breads, which reflect the country’s rich culture and hospitality. The combination of scenic landscapes and
            flavorful food makes Jordan a truly unforgettable destination.</p>

                    Jordan’s culture shines through its food and traditional attire. Mansaf, the national dish, is a flavorful lamb
                    and rice meal with rich yogurt sauce, symbolizing hospitality. Traditional clothing, like embroidered dresses
                    for women and the keffiyeh for men, reflects Jordan’s heritage and craftsmanship.
